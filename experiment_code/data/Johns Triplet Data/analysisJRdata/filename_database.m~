% outer code for subject 3 data

% starts with subject 3 files for conds df = 4, 5, 6 
datafiles(ind) = struct('filename','03.08.06.2011.1.mat', ...       1
    'subj_folder','03', 'trial_num',1, 'condn_order',[0 5 6 4], ...

% now I was told to include data in
% 'JR_NotesforSara_SteadyTriplet_RawDataOnly.pdf to only include data with
% descriptor in last column of doc, "Condns DF..." because those would
% contain keyholds; but I found one of these files must have had presses,
% not holds, as running KPushETs_ss on this file yields average durations
% as ~.1 sec, as does the "data" field of the struct.
