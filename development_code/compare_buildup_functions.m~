% I also need to remember that the BUF from make_buildup_function3 is from
% 0:T, whereas BUF from make_fourier_buildup_function is from -T:T



function error = compare_buildup_functions(bufpars,BUF,tax)

[BUFproposed t] = make_fourier_buildup_function(bufpars);

BUFproposed = BUFproposed(t>0); % 
BUF_adj = interp1(tax,BUF,t(t>0));

error = sum((BUFproposed - BUF_adj).^2);
