The ideal code library for my PhD dissertation would look something like this:

lib/ & lib/test/: a library of functions with generic applications to both real and simulated data, eg find_gamma_pars, find_fourier_fit, make_fourier_BUF, make_switchTriggeredBUF, make_trialAveragedBUF, calcRsquared, etc

experiment_code/: code for running experiments, with subfolders for each expt

experiment_data/ & experiment_data/figs/: 

simulation_code: i may want to split this up into neural and population dynamical models

simulation_data & simulation_data/figs
